# GeoTrellis Demo Template Hi-fi Prototype
Mostly HTML and SASS. Plus a bit of JS to demonstrate moving between states of
the app.

## Singleton vs Multiple layers
- Use `-singleton` class on a layer card or group when it's the only item.
- Use `-multiple-layers` class on a layer card or group otherwise.

## TODO
- Floater
- Compare
- Diff

---

## Installation and Use
Run `npm install` in the project directory to install required packages.

Run `grunt` to watch for file changes and automatically open browser to
`localhost:3000`.

## Things to note

### RSCSS
This prototype attempts to adhere to the [rscss](http://rscss.io/) guidelines
for SASS. It's quite similar to what we've used before at Azavea.

Worth reading through the [rscss docs](http://rscss.io/). It's a quick read.

[Summary](http://rscss.io/summary.html):

- Think in **components**, named with 2 words (`.screenshot-image`)
- Components contain **elements**, named with 1 word (`.blog-post > .title`)
- **Variant** classnames have a dash prefix (`.shop-banner.-with-icon`)
- Components can nest
- Use **@extends** to make things simple

Note the abundant use of the `>` **child selector**. When porting the prototype,
try to avoid anonymous wrapper elements and adhere to the prototype's DOM.
If you must add a wrapper somewhere, give it a suitable classname and insert
that into the SASS where appropriate. Eg:

- Before: `.page-header > .search-filter-bar`
- After: `.page-header > .search-filter-bar-container > .search-filter-bar`

### Responsive

This prototype uses [include-media](http://include-media.com/) for handling
breakpoints and related media queries (eg, retina).

Some examples:

```css
@include media('>phone') { }
@include media('>phone', '<=tablet') { }
@include media('>=358px', '<850px') { }
@include media('>desktop', '<=1350px') { }
@include media('retina2x') { }
@include media('>=350px', '<tablet', 'retina3x') { }
```

### SASS importing

This prototype uses `import-resolve` to automatically concatenate SASS files.
Unlike other prototype frameworks, you should **not** manually edit `main.sass`
to import all your SASS files. Simply create your files in their appropriate
subfolders and `import-resolve` will handle the rest whenever you run `grunt`.

Folders and files are imported in alphanumeric order, hence the `01_â€¦` folder
names. If you require a particular import order within a subfolder, be sure to
name the files accordingly.

Due to a bug in `import-resolve`, do not `@import` `url()`s in your SASS.
For example, use a `<link rel="stylesheet">` in your html to grab web
fonts instead of `@import`ing them in `_type.scss`. Importing local files
from elsewhere in the repo should work fine.


### main.js

No need to retain the actual code from `main.js` but be sure to replicate
what it does.
