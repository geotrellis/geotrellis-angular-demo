# Demo Type Definition

## Context

In this project, we use TypeScript as recommended in developing Angular 2 applicaiton.

It is optional to use type definitions, however, with type definitions, we could utilize the power of type auto-checking and fasten the development process.

## Definitions

All definitions used in this project are written in `typings/gd.d.ts`, exported as namespace `GD`.
